# Gin-Tonic

Collection of my own utility code for making games with SDL2

## Features
 - General SDL Utils, such as for error-messages
 - Sprite-sheet loading and displaying
 - ~~Simple fairly-quick Text-rendering (using above sprite-sheets)~~
 - ~~Text-Box Queues~~
 - ~~Simple 8-Bit-Style audio generation tools~~

## Future Improvements
 - Embed interface: Lets you embed a datablock file and fetch
   data from it easily (`embed.h`)
 - Network interface: Provides basic net utilities for hosting
   and connecting to servers. Maybe also net-event infrastructure
   (`network.h`)
